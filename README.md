# The Value of Urban Green Space: Analysing a Discrete Choice Experiment in the Largest German Cities

In this repository you find all material except for the data that was used to produce the paper "The Value of Urban Green Space: Analysing a Discrete Choice Experiment in the Largest German Cities".

For a full replication the survey data and the files of the estimated models are needed, if you want to replicate the analysis write me an email to: nino.cavallaro@idiv.de. 
I can then provide you with the required data in an anonymised form. 

To replicate the analysis you just have to run the "MAKE_FILE.R" in the "Code" folder. If you want to reestimate the models, you have to remove the # for the relevant lines in "MAKE_FILE.R",
otherwise the models are loaded in from the folder "Estimation_Results" (can be obtained on request).

The "Figures" and "Table" folders contain all figures and tables of the paper plus additional information. Everything is produced with the R-Code.

The "Estimation_log_files" folder provides the detailed estimation results of every single model.
